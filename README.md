:purple_heart: **Hey**, I'm Lyn (@1ynmuldrow).

I'm an engineer, educator, writer, and speaker, currently working with **Tidelift** to improve the lives of open source maintainers. I've helped to **build tools**
used across the industry, **educated audiences** of all ages through tech curriculum and tutorials, and **volunteer with organizations like Out In Tech** to uplift the
voices of those underrepresented in tech.

:sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:

Iâ€™m currently learning about new ways to engage in the open source community and am **looking to collaborate with projects built for social good**. I'm proficient
in a number of programming languages as well as in project management, support, and technical/docs writing.
